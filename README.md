Made a project that will integrate many things into a single platform.
In one platform students can track meetups,webinars,career guidance and notes of their subjects.
We were a team of 4 and we have made the whole project using HTML,CSS,JS,Bootstrap,django.
This is only the frontend of that project that i have contributed to.
